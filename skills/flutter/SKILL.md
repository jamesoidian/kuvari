# Flutter & Dart Conventions

## General Principles
- **Clean & Explicit**: Write readable and maintainable Dart code.
- **Safety First**: Avoid `any` types; prefer strict typing and sound null safety.
- **Consistency**: Follow existing patterns in the codebase for widgets and state management.

## Widget Guidelines
- Use `const` constructors whenever possible to improve performance.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Large widget trees should be split into smaller, focused widgets.
- Prefer `StatelessWidget` unless internal state is absolutely necessary.

## Localization
- Use the localized strings from the defined `l10n` setup.
- Do not hardcode user-facing strings in widget trees.

## Testing
- Ensure new features have corresponding unit or widget tests when applicable.
- Run tests regularly using `flutter test`.
